# RockStacking
I would like to use js to make a rock stacking game 

what do I think I need

MVP: I want to se the mouse to drag and drop "rocks" (polygons) on top of one another in an open world-ish canvas space. the goal would be to start on platforms and not let the peices fall off of them.

we will start by making a canvas that lets me pick up and move a single polygon
    this will need a size, a polygon and polygon size, an animation, it will ned gravity and collisions. 
    (we are doing this entirely from scratch because I was told to "get good" if i want  a job as a js developer)

    where to start?
        html page
            create canvas
